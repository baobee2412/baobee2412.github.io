    <h1>Journal 3</h1>
    <p>I have been a gaming player since I was little. There is one new hot trending online game that I have been recently playing is Genshin Impact. I got impressed with the gaming system, in-game graphic and the enticement of Gacha games, which is a kind of gambling. </p>
    <p>I would say that the marketing campaigns of this game were poor before releasing; that’s why I didn’t have any particular feelings towards this game at first. After a few hours of releasing this game, I completely immersed myself in it, and I felt adventurous when experiencing the game. I mainly felt excited when upgrading weapons successfully because the in-game resources are scarce and enhance weapons much depending on luckiness. However, after a month of experiencing, I realised that the game’s flow washed me away so far, it was like a fascinating dream, but I have to get up. I felt nostalgic, but I had to stop. </p>
    <p>The gaming developers have done so well in supporting for different platforms to play such as PC/laptop and mobile devices; the bright point is all of the databases of these platforms are connected, which creates a flexible environment for players playing the game anytime and anywhere; they can both play by PCs or smartphones. The graphic is not high evaluated by experts because of the limitation of the mobile device; this causes by the main path of developing this game to connect the database with different platforms together; With low budgets, players can afford an ordinary PC to perfectly playing the game, but to smoothly experience the game in smartphones, it might cost a lot to invest; that is why the graphic has to adjust the average standards to make a chance for everyone to play. On the other hand, the game is a bit gamble because it entices players to spend a lot of money to have 5-stars characters and 5-stars weapons.</p>
    <p>Although the game cost me a lot at first, I don’t regret it. I’m pretty picky in choosing games to play, and I don’t feel satisfied for a long time. I constantly played the game for one month after release, but then I quit. However, I started playing it again recently; but I would say that I controlled myself so well this time; I donate a little bit of money to smoothly play the game and show my respect to the qualified service bringing happiness to me. To not immerse me into it again, I keep in mind to stay conscious and stop playing after accomplishing in-game errands; it costs me 30 minutes to an hour to play only. I would play this game for a little bit longer, but I have a schedule for balancing entertainments, studying and working.</p>
