    <h1>Action Plan</h1>
    <p>During the Introduction to Science and Technology course, I learned some things new to support my future student life, such as ultimately using the benefits of the library, practising and improving presentation, getting to know about cryptography, etc. On top of that, this course somehow gave me extra thoughts and had an overall look at RMIT school to manage my plans well for my future paths. Thus, there are three factors that I have to manage well such as games, the library and professors.</p>
    <p>I have played games since I was little; playing games too much might negatively affect my study, but it became my identity; I cannot deny it, but I can control it. As a first-year full-time student, I will have approximately 8 hours a day to do what I want. I’m not addicted to games such as playing all day. However, if I don’t play it even a few times a day, I will feel missing and uncomfortable. I will set three 45-minute periods in my timetable to play games; I’ll call that “short-term demanding satisfaction”. I can gradually satisfy my demand for the visual world for a while, spend the rest of my time doing sovmething else, and get back to study as usual.</p>
    <p>The autonomy study is required in the university. In this case, I must research a lot, and the RMIT library will help me to improve my knowledge. However, the human brain will forget approximately 2,000 pixels every day. Thus, reading only is not the best method for long-term study, but it is required to have a break and review. Once I have to read a book for any random challenging questions or topics from my professors, I will set up four 45-minute periods as four steps; they are collecting information by reading, taking note, evaluating and analysing. I also have 10 minutes break in each step to recover energy for my brain. I know that I will have many unknown issues because Information Technology is a challenging field; Once I get stuck, I will take notes and try to research at first; if I cannot find solutions, I will try the RMIT booking appointment system with professors.</p>
    <p>In summary, I will have my way of time management depending on the school timetable. Nevertheless, I will probably spend at least six extra hours a day studying by reviewing previous lessons, taking notes on unknown issues and asking professors for help.</p>
