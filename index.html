    <p>As a positive-born person, I am hardly ever stressed towards something but bored. There is something that I have been contributing since I was little, which is playing games; It is one of my predominant favourites getting me out of the boredom of life. One online game, which is released more than ten years ago in Korea as a home server and many servers in other nations that I have pursued for more than two years, is called Blade and Soul. </p>
    <p>As an easily-to-get-bored person, I have always felt disappointed and changed hundreds of games since I was little because they are easy to be defeated and somehow pay-to-win games. However, Blade and Soul was a big boom to mindset since I first experienced it five years ago in Vietnamese server. I feel challenged because it is a combination of teamwork and self-training, which requires personal skills and being strong-willed to play in a team. Although I was a bit suffocated at first, I got totally into it after experiencing this game. </p>
    <p>This game has done well from internal factors to external factors. For instance, the graphic is unreal engine technology, the potential trading environment for free-to-play players, monthly and weekly events to collect upgrading-weapon materials, providing a flexible, communicative environment for players to get in touch and do transactions; also the main story is interesting which directly related to every big update; the mechanic of games is excellent which requires players to evaluate monsters attacks to evade and proper movements with teammates to annihilate the dungeon.</p>
    <p>Developing is always a challenging maths to solve; it is not only the responsibility of internal faculties as R&D but also external ones as Customer Service. Accordingly, I believe that the most crucial reason making the lifespan of this game longer is the in-game market in Vietnamese server because developing a game effectively is directly related to the culture of the destinated server. In Vietnamese server, the developing teams of this game have done well to indirectly balance the exchange rate between in-game currency to VND currency, which impeccably provides a potential environment for free-to-play players and pay-to-win players, also a promised land for intermediaries as “gaming businessmen” who playing games to live by trading in-game items to VND currency. The graphic is a bit old by using Unreal Engine 3; However, there is an announcement of upgrading the graphic to Unreal Engine 4 this year. I saw an official video comparing EU3 and EU4, and I reckon that this will be the important historic milestone of this game. </p>
    <p>The game has done well so far in developing itself and giving memorable experiences for players. However, there is one strong point, also the week point of the game that developing teams should balance, it is the mechanic. The difficult level challenges old players with every big update but is a burden for new players due to the lack of personal skills, and essential information that makes new players stressful to handle and leading the worst situation is quitting the game. This consequence will directly affect the game’s lifespan.</p>

    <h1>Journal 2</h1>
    <p>In the previous course, I had a chance to book an interview with my professor to discuss group assignment, which was my first time interacting with professors like that. It gained me essential experiences to adapt to the new university environment, also how to solve self-problems directly related to assignments personally.</p>
    <p>I was a bit hesitant at first because I hadn’t done anything like booking an appointment with professors before, and the website’s display was a bit confused for me. However, after class, I spent a little bit of time asking my professors about using booking appointment features; I apparently felt more confident and knowledgeable about using that system.  </p>
    <p>I believe that the booking appointment system is extremely helpful for many reasons. This system helps students to solve problems when writing assignments because students might lose track of writing essays and lead to writing off the topic, extra-classes for students to deeply understand the topic in class, conveniently to use within the Canvas program, and the professors are flexible in rearranging self-schedules to adjust students’ rare mistakes. For instance, my groupmate booked an appointment with my professor to discuss a group assignment on Tuesday in the previous course. He thought that he successfully got an appointment on Tuesday. Thus, my whole team came to the meeting room on time on Tuesday. Unfortunately, the accident was that he somehow mistook and booked the appointment on Wednesday. However, the professor was willing to rearrange his work to join the meeting room with us and asked my teammate to be careful next time. I really appreciate my professor’s efforts. </p>
    <p>I learned that to achieve my goals by studying at RMIT university effectively; I have to use all of the given resources efficiently. For instance, the RMIT connection corner helps solve many things related to students’ experiences in the university as booking appointment instruction, crucial materials to applying for scholarships, exchanging programs, giving bits of advice and research about internship courses, etc. As I mentioned about my teammate’s mistake above, I reckon that I must be deliberated whenever using this booking appointment system. Moreover, to ultimately use the chance to study with the professors, there’s something that I have to carefully pay attention to, such as making a list of questions about the topic to spend the whole time with professors effectively; this action will link me to new random ideas to discuss and deeply expand the topic as well.    </p>

    <h1>Journal 3</h1>
    <p>I have been a gaming player since I was little. There is one new hot trending online game that I have been recently playing is Genshin Impact. I got impressed with the gaming system, in-game graphic and the enticement of Gacha games, which is a kind of gambling. </p>
    <p>I would say that the marketing campaigns of this game were poor before releasing; that’s why I didn’t have any particular feelings towards this game at first. After a few hours of releasing this game, I completely immersed myself in it, and I felt adventurous when experiencing the game. I mainly felt excited when upgrading weapons successfully because the in-game resources are scarce and enhance weapons much depending on luckiness. However, after a month of experiencing, I realised that the game’s flow washed me away so far, it was like a fascinating dream, but I have to get up. I felt nostalgic, but I had to stop. </p>
    <p>The gaming developers have done so well in supporting for different platforms to play such as PC/laptop and mobile devices; the bright point is all of the databases of these platforms are connected, which creates a flexible environment for players playing the game anytime and anywhere; they can both play by PCs or smartphones. The graphic is not high evaluated by experts because of the limitation of the mobile device; this causes by the main path of developing this game to connect the database with different platforms together; With low budgets, players can afford an ordinary PC to perfectly playing the game, but to smoothly experience the game in smartphones, it might cost a lot to invest; that is why the graphic has to adjust the average standards to make a chance for everyone to play. On the other hand, the game is a bit gamble because it entices players to spend a lot of money to have 5-stars characters and 5-stars weapons.</p>
    <p>Although the game cost me a lot at first, I don’t regret it. I’m pretty picky in choosing games to play, and I don’t feel satisfied for a long time. I constantly played the game for one month after release, but then I quit. However, I started playing it again recently; but I would say that I controlled myself so well this time; I donate a little bit of money to smoothly play the game and show my respect to the qualified service bringing happiness to me. To not immerse me into it again, I keep in mind to stay conscious and stop playing after accomplishing in-game errands; it costs me 30 minutes to an hour to play only. I would play this game for a little bit longer, but I have a schedule for balancing entertainments, studying and working.</p>

    <h1>Journal 4</h1>
    <p>I had a chance to experience one of the most significant value resources in RMIT before the lockdown, which is the library. I discovered around, experienced the searching and booking system, and learned to use some useful tools in the library. </p>
    <p>My first feeling after the first step into the library was a bit uncomfortable. The overall space was a bit small, which suffocated me a little bit. The crowd also caught my attention, and I felt like RMIT students are diligent because empty seats were almost occupied. Although the structures of the library weren’t interesting to me, the atmosphere was. I like the peaceful environment in the library the most. However, I was a bit lost, but after trying to calm down and look around, something caught my attention again, which is the computer system. I felt like the engineer who built this library was truly thinking about students’ experiences in all of the moments because much helpful stuff is installed inside.</p>
    <p>The most vital point of the library is the vast English learning resources to search. There is a small corner for photocopy and installed computers. The library has many seats where students can come and study quietly. RMIT students have to deal with many individual projects during studying and group projects;  there are two meeting rooms for students to stay and discuss in the library, so it is convenient. However, to be permitted using those two rooms, students have to book it in advance. Although everything seems suitable for student life, it still has something making me give a minus point for the library experience; it doesn’t have any vending machines. There is a water system installed on each floor, but I demand snacks sometimes. There was something quite valuable for the photocopy corner. It was the instructions because the machine was big and multi-functions. I had nothing ideas about how to use it at first, but then I realised that it was much easier than I thought it would.  </p>
    <p>The experience of the RMIT library was not fascinating, but I would say that it is still a comfortable zone to stay in for a while. During the new university student life, I will probably go to the library many times. The staff are amicable and willing to help students with everything related to the library, and I feel comfortable about that. Perhaps, I will have some plans to get back to the library more frequently because it is an inspiring place. </p>

    <h1>Action Plan</h1>
    <p>During the Introduction to Science and Technology course, I learned some things new to support my future student life, such as ultimately using the benefits of the library, practising and improving presentation, getting to know about cryptography, etc. On top of that, this course somehow gave me extra thoughts and had an overall look at RMIT school to manage my plans well for my future paths. Thus, there are three factors that I have to manage well such as games, the library and professors.</p>
    <p>I have played games since I was little; playing games too much might negatively affect my study, but it became my identity; I cannot deny it, but I can control it. As a first-year full-time student, I will have approximately 8 hours a day to do what I want. I’m not addicted to games such as playing all day. However, if I don’t play it even a few times a day, I will feel missing and uncomfortable. I will set three 45-minute periods in my timetable to play games; I’ll call that “short-term demanding satisfaction”. I can gradually satisfy my demand for the visual world for a while, spend the rest of my time doing sovmething else, and get back to study as usual.</p>
    <p>The autonomy study is required in the university. In this case, I must research a lot, and the RMIT library will help me to improve my knowledge. However, the human brain will forget approximately 2,000 pixels every day. Thus, reading only is not the best method for long-term study, but it is required to have a break and review. Once I have to read a book for any random challenging questions or topics from my professors, I will set up four 45-minute periods as four steps; they are collecting information by reading, taking note, evaluating and analysing. I also have 10 minutes break in each step to recover energy for my brain. I know that I will have many unknown issues because Information Technology is a challenging field; Once I get stuck, I will take notes and try to research at first; if I cannot find solutions, I will try the RMIT booking appointment system with professors.</p>
    <p>In summary, I will have my way of time management depending on the school timetable. Nevertheless, I will probably spend at least six extra hours a day studying by reviewing previous lessons, taking notes on unknown issues and asking professors for help.</p>
